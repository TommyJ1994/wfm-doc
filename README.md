# Raincatcher Documentation

## Overview

This repository contains useful documentation for developers wishing to use Raincatcher modules and demo apps.

## Getting Started With The Demo Solution

The [Getting Started With The Demo Solution Guide](Getting-Started.md) demonstrates how to use the Red Hat Mobile Application Platform (RHMAP) to import the demo solution and get it up and running.

## Demo Solution Architecture

The [Demo Solution Architecture](Demo-Solution-Architecture.md) document describes the architecture of the Demo solution and how it integrates with Raincatcher modules.

## Running The Demo Solution Locally

The [Running The Demo Raincatcher Solution Locally](Running-Locally.md) guide explains how to get the Raincatcher demo solution running on your local development machine. This is targeted at developers that wish to extend the existing functionality of Raincatcher modules and demo apps.

## Integrating A New Module Into The Demo Solution

The [Module Integration](Module-Integration.md) guide explains how a new module can be introduced to the overall solution to provide extra functionality.
